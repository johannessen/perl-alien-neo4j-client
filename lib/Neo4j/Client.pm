=head1 NAME

Neo4j::Client - Build and use the libneo4j-client library

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
 use Neo4j::Client;
 
 WriteMakefile(
   LIBS => join(' ',$YOURLIBS, $Neo4j::Client::LIBS),
   CCFLAGS => join(' ',$YOURCCFLAGS, $Neo4j::Client::CCFLAGS),
   ...
 );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Chris Leishman's
L<libneo4j-client|https://github.com/cleishm/libneo4j-client> is a C
library for communication with a Neo4j (<v4.0) server via the Bolt
protocol. Installing this module will attempt to build the (static)
library on your machine (particularly for the use of
L<Neo4j::Bolt>). It will build with TLS support if OpenSSL
libraries/includes are found.

Use the (fully qualified) C<$Neo4j::Client::LIBS> and C<$Neo4j::Client::CCFLAGS>
to fold the library in to compilation and linking.

The script C<neoclient.pl> will provide these on the command line.
